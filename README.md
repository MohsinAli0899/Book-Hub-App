Users can also see the book's description. Users can view, and read the bookâ€™s description. 

There is also a fragment called 'Favorites' which is totally functional and lets you add your favorite books to it. It is connected with live API. The app is made using Kotlin and XML in Android Studio. 

When the device doesn't have a network connection, the app asks the user to either exit or connect to the network by opening the phone settings. The concept of API, JSON, and Volley Library is used to build this project.
